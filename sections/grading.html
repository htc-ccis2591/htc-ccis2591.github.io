          Weekly assignments are expected to be completed on-time. It is important that you practice what you learn on a weekly basis in order to keep up with the material. To support this and to allow discussion of assignments in-class, this work is not accepted. However, I do understand that life happens, and your lowest weekly assignment score will be dropped to account for this.

          The project assignments are longer and more involved, asking you to build on and combine skills that you have learned in previous assignments.  Project assignments also include an in-class presentation of your work which encourages the development of presentation and speaking skills as well as the ability to look at and review other peopleâ€™s code.
