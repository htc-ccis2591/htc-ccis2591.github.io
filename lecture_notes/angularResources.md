We're talking about Angular tonight.  It isn't discussed heavily in the book, but that's fine, because there are all sorts of resources on the web.  However we're going to look at Angular 2 which is still in beta anyway, so no books yet.  But we'll be brave!

Check out the Angular website at: [https://angular.io/](https://angular.io/)

Angular 2 is intended to support development in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Dart.  However the current examples are mainly done in TypeScript, so that gives us an opportunity to explore a little bit of TypeScript too.  TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and it provides options for static typing, classes and interfaces.  It is open source and developed and maintained by Microsoft.
